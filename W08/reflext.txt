The most important parts to study in W8 and MILESTONE3 is virtual function. 
A virtual function is a member function declared within a base class and overridden by a derived class. 
When an object of a derived class is referenced using a pointer or a reference to a base class, 
we can call virtual functions on that object and execute functions of the derived class. 
Virtual functions must be declared in 'public'. 
In workshop8, 'iAccount class' is interface which is an abstract base class with only pure virtual functions. 
So, I put the word 'virtual' in front of the function and declare it as '=0' after the prototype of the function. 
In 'Account class', the actual implementation of 'credit' and 'debit' occurs.
In MS3, Streamable Interface module and Publication class module all were not easy at all. 
Especially, 'istream& read(istream& istr) in Publicaion.cpp' this function was the most hardest one. 
It was long process and spend many of times.
