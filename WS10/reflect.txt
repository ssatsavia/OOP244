\
In addition to the concepts covered in the workshop and project milestones, the incorporation of function templates, a derived class with a resource, and virtual functions with abstract base classes further enriched my understanding of C++ programming. \
Function templates introduced the concept of generic programming, enabling the creation of reusable functions that operate on different data types. \
\
This allowed me to write templates for common operations like swapping elements, finding the maximum or minimum value in an array, or performing arithmetic operations. Implementing a derived class with a resource allowed me to explore inheritance and polymorphism in C++.\
 By inheriting from the base class (Book or Student), I gained insights into extending existing functionality while adding new features specific to managing a resource, such as file handling or network connections. The use of virtual functions and abstract base classes introduced the concept of dynamic polymorphism and runtime binding. \
By defining virtual functions in an abstract base class, I learned how to create a common interface for derived classes while allowing each derived class to implement its specific behaviour. \
\
Through the integration of these advanced C++ features, I strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming principles, code reuse, and the importance of designing flexible and maintainable software systems.\
Despite facing initial challenges with memory management and pointer manipulation, the workshop materials and hands-on practice helped me overcome these difficulties and deepen my comprehension of these concepts. Overall, the workshop and project milestones provided a comprehensive learning experience, equipping me with valuable skills applicable to real-world software development scenarios.}
